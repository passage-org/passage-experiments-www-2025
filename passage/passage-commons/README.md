# Passage's commons

Basic interface mostly featuring `Backend` and
`BackendIterator`. Implementing these interfaces eases the integration
of backends (such as [HDT](https://github.com/rdfhdt/hdt-java),
[TDB2](https://github.com/apache/jena/tree/main/jena-tdb2), or
[Blazegraph](https://github.com/blazegraph/database)).
